## üîß Development Workflow

### Making Changes

1. **Create a feature branch**:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   # or
   git checkout -b fix/your-bug-fix
   ```

2. **Make your changes** following our coding standards

3. **Test your changes**:
   ```bash
   # Run tests
   go test ./...
   
   # Build and test manually
   go build -o odyc .
   ./odyc sprites --assets ./test-assets --output ./test.js
   ```

4. **Format and lint**:
   ```bash
   # Format code
   go fmt ./...
   # or
   ./format.sh
   
   # Run linter
   golangci-lint run
   # or  
   ./lint.sh
   ```

5. **Commit your changes**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: add new sprite processing feature"
   ```

### Commit Message Guidelines

We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification:

- `feat:` - New features
- `fix:` - Bug fixes
- `docs:` - Documentation changes
- `style:` - Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor:` - Code refactoring
- `test:` - Adding or modifying tests
- `chore:` - Maintenance tasks

**Examples:**
```
feat: add support for JPEG sprite processing
fix: handle empty sprite directories gracefully
docs: update installation instructions
refactor: simplify color indexing algorithm
```

### Pull Request Process

1. **Update your branch** with upstream changes:
   ```bash
   git fetch upstream
   git rebase upstream/main
   ```

2. **Push your changes**:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

3. **Create a Pull Request** on GitHub with:
   - Clear title and description
   - Reference to related issues (if any)
   - Screenshots/examples (if applicable)
   - Confirmation that tests pass

## üéØ Coding Standards

### Code Style

- Follow standard Go conventions and idioms
- Use `go fmt` for consistent formatting
- Write clear, descriptive variable and function names
- Add comments for complex logic
- Keep functions small and focused

### Error Handling

- Always handle errors appropriately
- Use descriptive error messages
- Wrap errors with context when needed:
  ```go
  if err != nil {
      return fmt.Errorf("failed to process sprite %s: %w", filename, err)
  }
  ```

### Logging

- Use the project's logging system (`charmbracelet/log`)
- Choose appropriate log levels:
  - `log.Error()` - Critical errors
  - `log.Warn()` - Warnings that don't stop execution
  - `log.Info()` - General information
  - `log.Debug()` - Detailed debugging information

### Testing

- Write tests for new functionality
- Maintain or improve code coverage
- Use table-driven tests when appropriate
- Test both happy path and error cases

**Test Example:**
```go
func TestSpriteProcessing(t *testing.T) {
    tests := []struct {
        name        string
        inputFile   string
        expected    SpriteMetadata
        expectError bool
    }{
        {
            name:        "valid sprite",
            inputFile:   "test-sprite.png",
            expected:    SpriteMetadata{/* ... */},
            expectError: false,
        },
        // Add more test cases...
    }
    
    for _, tt := range tests {
        t.Run(tt.name, func(t *testing.T) {
            // Test implementation
        })
    }
}
```
